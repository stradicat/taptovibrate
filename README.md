# Tap to Vibrate
## a haptic experiment accessing the phone vibrator for different purposes

This is an experiment in accessing phone hardware, from older legacy devices to newer flagship phones.
The purpose is essentially communicating app events via tactile feedback, as to either minimize screen interaction because of the task's nature, or providing additional feedback as an accessibility feature.
